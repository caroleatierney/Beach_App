Wish List:
add map link
add carousel for each beach
add Bluefish Cove
add 4th cliff
add blackman's point

Something new I taught myself:
Bulma
PERN
finally was able to have just one thing update and save the other fields and then use the saved fields to set state

Explains the technical details
too afraid to use multiple files or arrays so I did a lot of string manipulation to create arrays and map through them

Explains the technical challenges
kept getting errors when tring to make a carousel in Bulma
problems reading data using a fetch because I needed to do the JSON part

Explains which improvements you might make

Extras:
used an api
used bulma
styled readme
