It is six miles long and has lots of things to do.  There are two parts to this beach.  On one side is the beautiful South River which has walking trails, fishing, kayaking and swimming especially fun for my dog!  On the other side is the dunes and the beach.  The waves are often big enough to surf.  There is a Jetty that the kids like to walk on.  The paths from the parking lot to the beach are beautiful.  This river and the beach are popular photography sites.  The sun sets over South River and you can sit on one of the many benches and enjoy the view.  There are sleek cranes and other shorebirds to view in the marsh along the river.  You may also see an occasional red or grey fox, cottontail rabbits and coyotes.  This beach is very family friendly.  There are public restrooms, a foot washing station, a basketball court and a snack bar. There is a small fenced in playground. The Beach is open from Memorial Day to Labor Day.', 42.124, -70.677);
